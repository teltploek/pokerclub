## Pokerklub

Just a repository for my private poker club statistics website.

Using Yeoman, Backbone, Aura JS and PHP/MySQL/Silex for the backend.

# Fixmes

 * ~~some times leaderboard isn't loading~~ Note-to-self: Backbone.Router wont trigger navigate if route hasn't changed.
 * ~~#leaderboard/points/desc/2013/2 jumps to #leaderboard/points/desc/2013/all on F5 refresh~~

# Next up - in random order

 * Porthole widget - to emphasize the ones to beat
 * ~~Title widget - to show chosen filter~~
 * ~~Hide 'per round' columns on round selection~~
 * ~~Sorting should also change url~~
 * Layout and styling
 * ~~Explanatory popovers on <th>'s' in leaderboard~~
 * ~~Title widget should only reload if there's changes in round or season - not when changing sort order.~~
 * Google Analytics
 * When sorting first sort per sortentity then it's sortentity per game (if any)
 * Add sort entity and order to subtitle <- needs pretty translation for entity
 * New columns:
 	* First time out
 	* Tournaments won
