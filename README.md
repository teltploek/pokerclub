## Pokerklub

Just a repository for my private poker club statistics website.

Using Yeoman, Backbone, Aura JS and PHP/MySQL/Silex for the backend.

# Fixmes

 * ~~some times leaderboard isn't loading~~ Note-to-self: Backbone.Router wont trigger navigate if route hasn't changed.
 * ~~#leaderboard/points/desc/2013/2 jumps to #leaderboard/points/desc/2013/all on F5 refresh~~

# TODOS

 * Porthole widget - to emphasize the ones to beat above leaderboard
 * Title widget - to show chosen filter
 * Hide 'per round' columns on round selection
 * Sorting should also change url
 * Google Analytics
