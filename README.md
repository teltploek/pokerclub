## Pokerklub

Just a repository for my private poker club statistics website.

Using Yeoman, Backbone, Aura JS and PHP/MySQL/Silex for the backend.

# Fixmes

 * Sometimes when loading the root the leaderboard isn't rendering - probably some sort of race condition.

# Next up - in random order

 * Porthole widget - to emphasize the ones to beat
 * ~~Title widget - to show chosen filter~~
 * ~~Hide 'per round' columns on round selection~~
 * ~~Sorting should also change url~~
 * Layout and styling
 * ~~Explanatory popovers on <th>'s' in leaderboard~~
 * ~~Title widget should only reload if there's changes in round or season - not when changing sort order.~~
 * Google Analytics
 * When sorting first sort per sortentity then it's sortentity per game (if any)
 * Add sort entity and order to subtitle <- needs pretty translation for entity
 * New columns:
 	* First time out
 	* Tournaments won
